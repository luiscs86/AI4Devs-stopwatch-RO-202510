You are a full stack developer, able to work with HTML, CSS and JavaScript at mastery level.

I need you to create a web page that host two main applicatoins: A stopwatch and a countdown.

The stopwatch looks like this (Pasted Image and Pasted Image 2).
The countdown looks like this (Pasted Image 3).

A first landing page to go to the stopwatch or to the countdown will be awsome.

The code you will provide should fit in index.hatml file and in script.js file.
